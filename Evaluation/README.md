# Data Science Evaluation Application

This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application developed as part of a data science evaluation task. The application includes two primary tasks:

1. **Real Estate Price Prediction**: A linear regression model is used to predict real estate prices based on features such as transaction date, house age, distance to MRT stations, number of convenience stores, latitude, and longitude.

2. **Time Series Analysis of Household Power Consumption**: A time series model is used to analyze and forecast household power consumption data.

## Summary

The application is designed to allow users to upload their datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with interactive visualizations, build and evaluate models, and compare the models' predictions with actual values. 

### Key Features:
- **Upload Dataset**: Users can upload their datasets, which are then processed by the application for analysis.
- **EDA and Visualization**: The application provides interactive visualizations using Altair to help users gain insights from their data.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**: For the real estate task, a linear regression model is built and evaluated. For the time series task, a suitable time series model is selected and evaluated.

### Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Science-Evaluation.git
   cd Data-Science-Evaluation
